<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Since I came to Iasi, me and my friend (who is also pretty passionate about amateur radio) really wanted to check out airband traffic, because we live <i>relatively</i> close to the Iasi Airport.</p>
<p>But first of all, let me make a quick introduction to amateur radio and all the shenanigans related to it.</p>
<h2>What is Amateur Radio?</h2>
<p>To directly quote Wikipedia, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio">Amateur radio</a>, also known as ham radio, is the use of the radio frequency spectrum for purposes of non-commercial exchange of messages, wireless experimentation, self-training, private recreation, radiosport, contesting, and emergency communications."</p>
<p>Because the radio space is regulated, to be able to transmit, one needs a amateur radio license, just like a driving license. To get such license, one needs to take a certain exam for the category they wish to use; each category allowing the owner of the license to transmit at different power rates.</p>
<p>Another cool thing about amateur radio communications is the fact that each amater radio operator (also called "ham radio operator") gets a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_call_signs">callsign</a> that is used to identify the operator. Each operator is required by law to announce their callsign at the beginning of each transmission.</p>
<p>Well, I want to get my ham radio license, but that will have to wait because of college :(</p>

<h2>Then what is airband?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airband">Airband</a> is the name for a group of frequencies allocated to radio communications for aviation.</p>
<p>Because there is an airport nearby, we thought we should be able to receive airband traffic quite easily (props to my friend for his idea).</p>
<p>So the software-defined radios become handy again (just like in the <a href="satrx.html">amateur satellite reception post</a>).</p>
<p>We tuned our dipole antennas (check out the calculator under this paragraph) to match the frequency used by the Iasi Internation Airport <a href="https://skyvector.com/airport/LRIA/Iasi-Airport">(119.95 MHz)</a>, hooked up the <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-blog-v-3-dongles-user-guide/">RTL-SDR V3</a> to the computer along with a LNA to increase our signal gain.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Here is a little calculator for dipole length
<br/>(1 dipole leg length, taking into account the end effect<sup><a href="https://www.dj0ip.de/ricki-leaks/ocfd-end-effect/">[1]</a></sup>)</h3>

<h2>Well, here you go</h2>
<p>Now you can check out what we received from the Iasi International Airport airband frequency below (props to my friends for the footage):</p>
